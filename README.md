A very short project where I implemented my own function for calculation - PCA
PCA is a Exploratory Data Technique to reduce the dimensions of the data.

pca.py has the function
<br>
<br>
Then in the python notebook I have compared it with the values from sklearn library.

Citation - I saw and understood someone's code and modified it to suit my needs. <br>
