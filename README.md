Principal Component Analysis [PCA]
A very short project where I implemented by own function for calculation - PCA
PCA is a Exploratory Data Technique to reduce the dimensions of the data.

pca.py has the function

Then in the python notebook I have compared it with the values from sklearn library.

Citation - I saw someone's code and modified it to suit my needs. [I don't remember whose code it was, please write to me for any queires - sid.ronaldo1904@gmail.com]
